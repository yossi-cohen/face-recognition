    "## Playground framework for face recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cahpter describes a Python playground framework for fast prototyping of face detection and face recognition.  \n",
    "It integrates multiple face detection and face recognition models from basic models (e.g: Haar Cascades, HOG, LBPH) to more advanced models (e.g: MTCNN, FaceNet).  Each detector model has been made compatible with each embedding model to abstract from the differences.  Models differ in speed, accuracy, resource requirements and 3rd-party dependencies.  This enables to easily experiment with various solutions appropriate for specific use cases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The framework is designed to be modular, so that adding new detection or encoding modules is easy. Selection of models is done via the constructors while the exposed functions are detect() or encode() making usage very intuitive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the [git](https://github.com/yossi-cohen/face-recognition) repository of this framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "A facial recognition system is capable of verifying or identifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. At a minimum, a facial recognition system should contain the following pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Face Registration** registering faces to a database which includes pre-computing face embeddings and training a classifier on top of the face embeddings of registered individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Face Capture** - reading a frame image from a camera source.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Face Detection** - detecting faces in a frame image.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Face Encoding** - generating a mathematical representation of each face (aka embedding) in the input image/frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Face Identification** - identifying each face embedding in an image with face embeddings of known people in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "More complex systems may include features such as Liveness Detection (for anti-face spoofing attacks), face landmark detection, face alignment, face augmentation (to increase the number of images in a dataset) and face verification.  Such systems may include also: age detection, gender detection, ethnicity detection, emotion detection, smile intensity detection, facial expression analysis etc.  \n",
    "Some of these may be added to this framework in the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This framework supports several models for each step of the Face Recognition pipeline.  Some models are faster while some are more accurate. You can mix and match the models for your specific use-case, hardware platform and system requirements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework and examples have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 laptop (Python 3.6.7) using OpenCV 4.1.0, Dlib 19.17.0, Tensorflow 1.13.1 and Keras 2.2.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "```\n",
    " 1. Install Python 3.6 and PIP:\n",
    "    sudo apt-get update & sudo apt-get install python3.6\n",
    "    sudo apt install python3-pip\n",
    "    \n",
    " 2. Install the required package dependencies using requirements.txt:\n",
    "    pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source folder structure\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/face-recognition-src-tree.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```examples``` folder contains code examples for face detection and face recognition.  These examples may be used directly or through the corresponding cli code. ```face_detection_cli.py``` and ```face_recognition_cli.py``` are the two cli entry points used for detection and recognition. The cli files expose command-line arguments to ease the usage of the examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The folders listed below are used by the example code and may be populated by the framework user:  \n",
    "(any other folders may be used by specifying them in the command line arguments)\n",
    "```\n",
    "examples/face_recognition/known_faces\n",
    "examples/face_recognition/unknown_faces\n",
    "examples/face_recognition/videos\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```lib``` folder contains the code for abstracting the different models for detection, recognition, landmarks detection and embedding database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use the framework for detection or face recognition, the ```known_faces``` and ```unknown_faces``` folders should be populated with images for learning and testing respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The ```known_faces``` folder may contain images or sub-folders.  Images not under a sub-folder should have name corresponding to the name of the person to identify in the face recognition process. Multiple images for a single person are also supported and may yield better recognition results. Multiple images of the same person should be place under a folder named with the person_name.  The ```videos``` folder may contain video file for testing the face recognition after it is train on the ```known_faces``` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
